## Motivation

Humans are adept at shaping reality and judging the world. Give them just a sample, and they will make generalizations that are as imprecise as they are prejudiced.

Being aware of this mental limitation elevates our decision-making to a new level. It leads us to a realm of controlled risk but also presents numerous methodological challenges.

We have at our disposal not just a single scientific tool to navigate this landscape, but many: science, engineering and data architecture, data analysis, statistics, and machine learning.

In this portal, my goal is to present various areas of interest through the lens of Data Science.

Happy reading.
